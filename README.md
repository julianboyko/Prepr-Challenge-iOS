# iOS Prepr Challenge
Challenge: Create an app that uses a database, includes authentication (users, login, logout) and contains a third party integration of your choice (eg. Google Maps API)

Result: This app uses Firebase to store user documents and includes a signup/login/logout flow. Additionally, you can store addresses under your user account, which once cilcked displays a GoogleMap of the location with a marker.
